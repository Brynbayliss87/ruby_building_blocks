Challenges from The Odin Projects Ruby building blocks section.

These include:

A Caeser Cypher method that takes a string and encrypts it using a Caeser Cypher.

A stock picker that takes an array of prices for each day and returns the best day to buy and sell.

A substring method that takes a string as a first argument and an array of substring as a second.
It then tells you how many times a substring was found in each word of the first string.
